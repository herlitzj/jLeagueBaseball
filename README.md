Turning the Internet Baseball League tabletop rules into a web and mobile based baseball simulation

Starting down the road to what could be quite a long project. I've been toying around with the mechanics of turning the IBL tabletop game into a full baseball simulator that will start as a web app and maybe eventually migrate to mobile.

For the moment, this README will probably just be a bit of a blog of my ideas and the mechanics for the game. Over time, it will hopefully morph into an actual README, but I've gotta start somewhere.

I've been working on the mechanics of how a dice roll will be turned into an actual play. At this time, this doesn't involve the database, but I think I have come up with a good method for making this work. See the play_mechanics_test.rb file for the latest attempt.
